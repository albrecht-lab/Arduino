# Arduino Controllers

These files are to be uploaded on Arduino Uno boards used for (1) mult-well plate position and servo control (MicrowellPlateControlServo), and  (2) for camera relay and valve controls (BiovisionController). Please contact albrechtlab@wpi.edu for further instruction and Arduino Uno pin layout.

For ease of uploading to your arduino controllers, we reccommend using our CodeBender repo:
